Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems like Whisper have revolutionized human-technology interaction through accurate transcription across diverse languages and conditions. Yet, they face challenges with disruptions, filler words such as "umm" and "uhh," and esoteric noises like whistles or humming. Improving Whisper’s ability to handle these complexities is crucial for its application in real-world settings, where speech is rarely clean or uninterrupted.

Background noise and overlapping speech are significant hurdles for ASR systems. Real-life conversations occur in noisy environments, introducing artifacts that impair transcription accuracy. Filler words, often dismissed as noise, convey semantic importance, signaling hesitation or thought processes. Better recognition of these elements could enhance Whisper’s utility in tasks like real-time subtitles and customer service, fostering more human-like interactions.

Esoteric sounds, such as humming or whistles, present another challenge. These non-verbal cues carry contextual and emotional significance, enriching communication. For example, a whistle might signal approval, while humming suggests agreement. By recognizing these sounds, Whisper could broaden its applications, particularly in assistive technologies that depend on capturing non-verbal communication.

High-quality datasets are essential for addressing these issues. The CALLHOME American English Speech corpus, with its time-aligned transcriptions of conversational speech, helps train models to manage disruptions and filler words. Similarly, the AMI Meeting Corpus’ multimodal data, including audio and annotations, supports distinguishing esoteric noises and interruptions. The TED-LIUM corpus, known for its precise transcriptions, bridges the gap between scripted and spontaneous speech, aiding ASR systems in capturing natural disfluencies. Combining these datasets offers a comprehensive approach to improving ASR capabilities.

Enhancing Whisper’s ability to manage disruptions and recognize diverse sounds would expand its usability. Real-time captioning for individuals with hearing impairments could become more effective, capturing nuances missed by current technologies. Broader applications, from teleconferencing to entertainment, would benefit from ASR systems with human-like, context-aware transcriptions.

In summary, the future of ASR systems like Whisper relies on addressing real-world speech complexities. Leveraging diverse, high-quality datasets is key to bridging the gap between human and machine communication, enabling more inclusive and effective technological interactions.
